# gochoose

A very simple engine for web-based CYOA games. To install the example application, do:

```sh
$ go get -d gochoose-example
$ go install gochoose-example
```

Or just run `build.sh` from the repository. The example application is commented and is a good place to start for guidance on how to use this module.
